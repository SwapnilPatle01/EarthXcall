Farmers in India often face issues like low crop prices, market
volatility, and climate change effects. Biofuel production offers them
new income streams by utilizing agricultural waste and non-food crops.
Sugarcane Farmers: India, the second-largest producer of sugarcane,
has a surplus production of sugarcane, making ethanol production from
molasses a viable option. The government has increased the procurement
price of ethanol from sugarcane-based molasses, ensuring higher
earnings for farmers.
Rice and Wheat Farmers: Paddy straw and wheat stubble, which are often
burnt causing severe air pollution in North India, are now being used
to produce ethanol. Projects like the Indore Bio-CNG Plant and other
Compressed Biogas (CBG) plants are encouraging farmers to sell their
waste instead of burning it.
Non-Food Crops: Crops like Jatropha, Pongamia, and Castor are being
promoted for biodiesel production, allowing farmers in dry regions to
grow sustainable fuel crops without affecting food supply.
